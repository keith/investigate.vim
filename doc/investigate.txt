1. Intro                                                   *investigate-intro*

Investigate is a plugin for viewing language documentation for the word under
the cursor.


==============================================================================
2. Functionality                                   *investigate-functionality*

Documentation can be viewed a few different ways. Using a custom command for a
file type that allows arbitrary commands to be run such as :h for vim. Using
Dash.app on Mac OS X. Or on the web. You can override any of the default
settings to make documentation open however you'd like using these methods.


==============================================================================
3. Configuration                                   *investigate-configuration*

Investigate provides tons of configurations to allow all language defaults to
be overridden on a global and per project basis. This can be done by setting
global vim variables or using a '.investigaterc' file in the root of the
directory vim is running from.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Variables                                          *investigate-variables*

There are quite a few different options that can be specified to change the
default settings, or add support for other languages. If you do want to add
other language support to investigate or change the default settings please
submit a pull request to the Github repository. If at anytime there are no
commands for the given filetype an error will be provided shown in the
command line. Please submit pull requests for any languages you would like
to see added to investigate.

                                                        *investigate_use_dash*
Default: 0
Set this variable to automatically open documentation in Dash.app when
you're on Mac OS X. If you're not on Mac OS X and this variable is set it
is ignored.
    let g:investigate_use_dash=1

Download Dash for OS X from http://kapeli.com/dash

                                      *investigate_use_command_for_<filetype>*
Tell investigate to use the custom command for a specific filetype. Since,
behind the scenes the custom command is the highest priority of command to
be run, you typically shouldn't need this. If you set this it will
automatically use a custom command for the filetype. It will first attempt
to run the command defined by |investigate_command_for_<filetype>| if there
is one, otherwise it will attempt to run the predefined custom command.
Setting this any of these to 0 will be useless. But you know, if you want..
    let g:investigate_use_command_for_ruby=1

                                         *investigate_use_dash_for_<filetype>*
Tell investigate to prioritize opening documentation in Dash.app over using
a custom command. You would want to use this if, for example, you wanted to
open Vim's documentation in Dash over opening it with :h. This will default
to using the Dash keyword defined by |investigate_dash_for_<filetype>| if
there is one, otherwise it will use the predefined Dash keyword.
    let g:investigate_use_dash_for_vim=1

                                          *investigate_use_url_for_<filetype>*
Tell investigate to prioritize the URL documentation viewer for the filetype.
You would use this if you wanted to make investigate show the documentation
on the web over showing a custom command or the dash page. For example if
you wanted to open most languages in Dash but wanted to open Rails
documentation in their awesome online API viewer you could set that up.
    let g:investigate_use_url_for_rails=1


                                           *investigate_syntax_for_<filetype>*
This variable by filetype allows you to alias one filetype to another. This
is evaluated before any other mappings. This means if you override the URL
settings for filetypeA and then alias filetypeB to filetypeA, filetypeB will
use the overridden URL. An real example being help which is mapped to vim by
default. Example:
    let g:investigate_syntax_for_rspec=ruby

                                          *investigate_command_for_<filetype>*
This variable allows you to set specific commands for a specific filetype.
See |investigate-writing-commands| for the setup on how to write the commands
with the correct replacements. This overrides the current set custom command
or it sets another command. I could imagine you attempting to set ri as the
default command for Ruby syntaxes. I haven't thought of a way to do that but
if you do I'd love to know about it! Here's what it would look like if the
default for vim hadn't already been set up.
    let g:investigate_command_for_vim=%i:h %s

                                             *investigate_dash_for_<filetype>*
This variable allows you to set specific Dash keywords for filetypes. You
would probably want to use this if you set up search profiles or changed
then names of any the default docsets in Dash to something more useful. You
don't need to add the : at the ed of the keyword. This remaps all ruby files
to open the rails documentation:
    let g:investigate_dash_for_ruby=rails

                                              *investigate_url_for_<filetype>*
This variable allows you to set the URL for a filetype to search through. See
|investigate-writing-commands| to see the exact syntax mapping a URL. You'd
want to do this if you don't agree with the site I picked to search for the
specific filetype. If you have a better one I'd love to hear about it via a
pull request. This is the default ruby URL but if you were redefining it:
    let g:investigate_url_for_ruby="http://ruby-doc.com/search.html?q=%s"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 Configuration File                                 *investigate-conf-file*

In the root of any directory a file can be created. This will
redefine the behavior of investigate when it's being run from that directory.
A simple example of this is a Rails project where you want to open the
documentation for Ruby files in the Rails API reference rather than Ruby's.
Lines starting with # are considered comments. In brackets you can put any
keyword that is an investigate variable. The current keywords are syntax,
command, dash, and url.

                                                *'investigate_local_filename'*
Default: ".investigaterc"
You can change the default name of the configuration file with this variable.
If you don't want the file to be hidden you can leave off the preceding dot.
    let g:investigate_local_filename=".invrc"

The contents of this file are expanded to look like:
    let g:investigate_<identifier>_for_<left>=<right>
Where <identifier> is the last word wrapped by brackets, <left> and <right>
are what's on the left and right side of the equals sign respectively.
Example:

    # Open ruby files as rails
    [syntax]
    ruby=rails

    # Custom command for vim
    # This is the default command for vim
    # This syntax is explained in |investigate-writing-commands|
    [command]
    vim=%i:h %s

    # Reassigns the dash identifier for a filetype
    [dash]
    html=web
    css=web

    # Default to Python 3 documentation
    [url]
    python="http://docs.python.org/3/search.html?q=%s"
